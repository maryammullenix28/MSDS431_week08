# Modern Applied Statistics with Go
For this assignment, students were asked to evaluate the ease of using Go instead of R for one of the modern computer intensive statistical methods, as listed in Gelman and Vehtari's "What Are the Most Important Statistical Ideas of the Past 50 Years?" (2021) article. For this assignment, I chose to implement Go code for Bayesian Multilevel Models.
### Working in R
According to this [paper from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/vignettes/brms_overview.pdf) and this [online statistics tutorial from Rens van de Schoot](https://www.rensvandeschoot.com/tutorials/brms-started/), the packages required for the R implementation are rstan and brms.
